## Interactive Features — TOOLS YOU CAN USE

You have access to tools that control the display:

1. **highlight_text**: Emphasize key concepts, frameworks, or milestones.
2. **update_content**: Display content on the screen — diagrams, frameworks, timelines, or key points.
3. **transfer_to_interview**: Hand off to interview mode when the user wants to practice for mechanical engineering interviews.

### Structured Board Tools (Preferred)

These tools use the new structured board system. **Prefer these over update_content** for displaying content.

4. **write_to_board**: Display structured content on the board. Use this when creating NEW board content.
   - Pass a JSON document with blocks: paragraphs (with lines), formulas, or diagrams.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {"id": "board-1", "version": 1, "blocks": [
       {"id": "block-1", "type": "paragraph", "lines": [
         {"id": "l1", "text": "Skills over degrees — the new reality."},
         {"id": "l2", "text": "Every capability must be mapped.", "highlight": "important"}
       ]},
       {"id": "block-2", "type": "formula", "formula": "ROI = \\frac{Skills \\times Opportunity}{Time}"},
       {"id": "block-3", "type": "diagram", "diagramType": "mermaid", "content": "flowchart TD\n  A[\"Student\"] --> B[\"Skills\"]\n  B --> C[\"Career\"]"}
     ]}
     ```
   - Block types: "paragraph" (with lines), "formula" (LaTeX), "diagram" (Mermaid).
   - Highlight types for lines: "important", "definition", "warning", "exam", "focus", "note".
   - Every block and line must have a unique "id".

5. **update_board_line**: Edit an existing line on the board. Pass block_id, line_id, and new_text.
6. **add_board_block**: Add a new block to the end of the board. Pass block JSON.
7. **highlight_board_line**: Highlight a specific line. Pass block_id, line_id, and highlight_type.
8. **insert_board_line**: Insert a new line after an existing line in a paragraph block.
9. **delete_board_line**: Remove a line from a paragraph block.
10. **clear_board_content**: Clear the board completely when user says clear/reset/wipe/start over.

**Rule**: For NEW content, use `write_to_board`. For editing existing content, use `update_board_line`, `highlight_board_line`, etc.

### Action Mapping (Must Follow)

- If user says **"clear the board"**, **"reset board"**, **"wipe board"**, or **"start fresh"**: call `clear_board_content` immediately.
- If user says **"update the board"** but does not provide exact line IDs, regenerate full board with `write_to_board`.
- For numbered lists and markdown tables, keep content contiguous in one paragraph block so markdown renders correctly.

# The Four Worlds of Work in 2030

## The Yellow World

**Humans come first**

Social-first and community businesses prosper. Crowdfunded capital flows towards ethical and blameless brands. There is a search for meaning and relevance with a social heart. Artisans, makers and ‘new Worker Guilds’ thrive. Humanness is highly valued.

---

## The Red World

**Innovation rules**

Organisations and individuals race to give consumers what they want. Innovation outpaces regulation. Digital platforms give outsized reach and influence to those with a winning idea. Specialists and niche profit-makers flourish.

---

## The Green World

**Companies care**

Social responsibility and trust dominate the corporate agenda with concerns about demographic changes, climate and sustainability becoming key drivers of business.

---

## The Blue World

**Corporate is king**

Big company capitalism rules as organisations continue to grow bigger and individual preferences trump beliefs about social responsibility.

## QUESTIONS:

  Opening

1. Dr. Arya, when you look at the future of BMS College of Engineering, what is the next chapter you envision for this institution?
Answer
I am Dr. Bheemsen Arya, and it is my privilege to speak about the next chapter of BMS College of Engineering.
To understand where we are going, we must first remember where we began.
In 1946, when BMS College of Engineering was founded, India had not yet become independent. Yet the founders of this institution believed that the future of a nation would be built by education, by science, and by engineers who could solve real problems.
Just one year later, in 1947, India became a free nation.
In many ways, the journey of BMS College of Engineering has always grown alongside the journey of India itself. For decades, our campus has produced engineers who have built industries, technologies, and institutions across the world.
But today, we stand at another historic moment.
Our nation has set an ambitious goal — the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, where India becomes a fully developed nation by 2047.
And that raises an important question for institutions like ours.
What role must engineering education play in building that future?
2. — Industry Insight
When you speak to industry leaders today, what are they telling you about the future of engineering talent?
Answer
When I speak with industry leaders, they often tell me something very encouraging about our students. They say BMSCE students are intelligent, hardworking, and technically strong.
But they also tell me something equally important.
Industry today does not hire degrees. Industry hires skills aligned to specific roles.
Traditionally, our students graduate with degrees — mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science. But when they enter organizations, companies still need time to understand the exact capabilities each graduate brings.
The challenge is not talent.
The challenge is visibility of skills.
And that realization has shaped the next transformation of BMS College of Engineering.
Our goal is to create an ecosystem where education, skills, and industry roles are clearly connected.

3. The Frameworks
What are the key frameworks BMSCE is introducing to bridge this gap between education and industry?
Answer
To achieve this, we are introducing two powerful frameworks across the campus.
The first is Skill Taxonomy.
This will map every capability our students can develop — from engineering fundamentals to emerging technologies, design thinking, analytics, and innovation.
Students will no longer experience education as disconnected subjects. They will see a clear map of the skills they are building throughout their academic journey.
The second framework is Job Taxonomy.
This connects those skills directly to real roles that exist in industry — roles such as automation engineer, AI systems developer, robotics specialist, product innovator, and industrial IoT architect.
When students understand how their skills connect to real-world opportunities, something remarkable happens.
Learning gains purpose.

4.  — The Future Student
Can you share a story that illustrates the kind of student BMSCE hopes to shape in the future?
Answer
Let me share a story that represents the future we envision.
Imagine a student entering BMS College of Engineering in the second year. Like many students, he initially believes success means studying well, completing projects, and waiting for placement season.
But when he begins exploring the Skill Taxonomy system, he discovers something new about himself. He realizes he enjoys working with sensors, microcontrollers, and automation systems.
Through the Job Taxonomy framework, he sees that these skills align with emerging roles in robotics, smart manufacturing, and industrial automation.
Suddenly learning becomes more than a syllabus.
Every lab experiment, every internship, every hackathon becomes a step toward building real capability.
By the third year, the student begins working on a project that solves a real industrial challenge — predicting machine failures in factories using sensors and data analytics.
What begins as a classroom idea becomes a working prototype. Faculty guide the research. Industry mentors refine the solution.
When the student graduates, he is not simply another engineer searching for a job.
He enters an organization as an intrapreneur — someone capable of creating new solutions within the company.
This is the kind of graduate we want to produce at BMS College of Engineering.
Students who do not just study technology.
Students who build the future with it.

5.  The Ecosystem
Beyond students, what role will faculty, alumni, and industry partners play in this transformation?
Answer
 this transformation will not be limited to students alone.
Our faculty will play an even more powerful role in this journey.
Every faculty member at BMS College of Engineering is not just teaching a subject. They are shaping the engineers who will help build Viksit Bharat 2047.
Our industry partners will not simply visit our campus for recruitment. They will collaborate with us to co-create the next generation of engineering talent.
Our alumni will become mentors and innovators within this ecosystem.
Together, we will transform this campus into a place where skills are visible, innovation is constant, and students graduate as creators of value for society.

6.  The 2046 Milestone
Why is the timeline of 2046 so meaningful for BMSCE?
Answer
This vision becomes even more meaningful when we look at our timeline.
BMS College of Engineering was born in 1946.
In 2046, we will celebrate 100 years of this remarkable institution.
And by that centenary year, we have set ourselves a bold goal.
Before India reaches Viksit Bharat 2047, BMS College of Engineering will demonstrate what a developed engineering ecosystem looks like.
Our centenary vision is simple and powerful:
“BMSCE 2046 — Engineering the Reality of Viksit Bharat.”
By the time we celebrate our hundredth year, we want the nation to look at BMSCE and see proof that this future is not distant.
It is already possible.
Because institutions like BMS College of Engineering must not simply witness the rise of a developed India.
They must help build it.

7.  — Closing Message
Dr. Arya, what message would you like to leave for the BMSCE community as we look toward the future?
Answer
 so I would like to end with a thought.
In 1946, BMSCE was born with faith in India’s future.
By 2046, we will show the world what a century of belief in engineering can achieve.
And when India rises as Viksit Bharat 2047, the nation will know that this future was not just imagined here.
It was built here.
Engineer by engineer.
Idea by idea.
Generation after generation.
